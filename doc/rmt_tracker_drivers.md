# Tracker Drivers

A tracker driver is part of the tracker that generates the actual sound from the tracker data and user input. In the case of RMT, the tracker diver is a piece of MOS 6502 code that runs on an emulated Atari 8-bit computer.

# Tracker Driver Versions

A tracker driver version is a variant of the tracker driver that interprets the data and user input differently. For example, different tracker driver versions have a distinct feature set or tuning. A correct replay of the music requires using the same tracker driver version that was used to create it.

The original tracker driver version is the one by Raster in RMT 1.28. Many people modified the driver code and data to yield new effects. All known older versions are preserved for compatibility.

Tracker driver versions are identified in different ways.
For inclusion into RMT, the tracker driver versions are numbered starting from 1 (0 is no driver).
The number is the one of `TRACKERDRIVERVERSION` in `rmt.ini`, of the constant in the source code (`TrackerDriverVersion.h`) and of the binary `resources/drivers/rmt_driver_v<code>.obx`.
Additionally, they have a readable name for users (the "RMT Driver Version" list of the Options dialog) and a name for scripts (`set driver`, see [rmt_scripting.md](rmt_scripting.md)).

The level of a driver is the RMT version whose driver code it is: the original by Raster or a patch of it.

| Code | Name in the Options dialog                    | Level (driver code)                  | Script name              | Constant name          | Author   |

The default is 6, Patch16.

Compatibility with the AUTOFILTER of RMT 1.28 (measured on a song that uses the AUTOFILTER: the frequency offset of channel 3 against channel 1 is the same as with the original RMT 1.28 player):

| Code | AUTOFILTER as RMT 1.28 |
|------|------------------------|
| 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 | yes        |
| 6    | no (see [RMT 1.34 Patch16 by VinsCool](#rmt-134-patch16-by-vinscool)) |


## RMT 1.28 Unpatched by Raster

The original RMT driver version that set the standard for many years with Atari 8-bit music. This version was mainly with RMT 1.28, as well as the unofficial RMT 1.30 by Rudla.

## RMT 1.28 Unpatched with Tuning

This driver version by VinsCool was never completed: the binary `rmt_driver_v2.obx` is the same as `rmt_driver_v1.obx`, so it plays exactly as RMT 1.28 Unpatched. It is listed so that a configuration or a script that names it keeps working.

## RMT 1.25 Patch3 Instrumentarium by Analmux

Adapted from Analmux's original post on [AtariAge](https://forums.atariage.com/topic/228757-instrumentarium-final-release-links-summary/): 
> The music track "Instrumentarium" is composed, tracked, and RMT-patched by me: ANALogue MUltipleXer. I used a patch to change some RMT possibilities: f.e, I added sawtooth wave (ringmod), triangle wave (linear subharmonic), clarinet (16-bit), distortion guitar (16-bit), and sync modes (2-tone filter & 16-bit). At the end of 2009, this tune was named "Instrumentarium Remix 1"; it's the same tune. I was using exotic undocumented POKEY features. It takes almost no CPU time.

## RMT 1.27 Patch6 by Analmux

Adapted from Analmux's original post on [AtariAge](https://forums.atariage.com/topic/175878-rmt-patch-6/):
> Tables freqtabbasslo and freqtabbasshi are patched (all I did was multiply each 16-bit value by 15). The '16-bit distortion 6' instrument, which was really a generator C instrument, is now a generator A instrument. I removed the blocking of the 1st channel, to enable 16-bit filter-like effects."

## RMT 1.34 Patch16 by VinsCool

This driver version is an extensive hack of the original RMT 1.28 driver by Raster, inspired directly by Analmux's RMT Patch8 hack. 
The new features include: more tuning tables, a two-tone filter toggle, an AUDCTL timing fix, AUTOFILTER behavior tweaks, etc.
Unfortunately, this patch also introduced many compatibility issues with older modules and a couple of bugs.
Despite that, this is probably the most "feature-rich" version of the RMT driver patches created so far.
All that came at the cost of extra memory usage and heavier CPU load, so this is no longer an "optimal" driver.
This is currently the default RMT driver version included and used by RMT 1.34 and later.
The driver code is version Patch16-3.2 (`asm/Patch-16/rmtplayr.a65`), used by RMT since version 1.31; the name in the Options dialog says RMT 1.34, the version that made it the default.

The AUTOFILTER is one of these compatibility issues: Patch16 starts the frequency offset of channel 3 at 0 instead of 1 and does not accumulate the command 6, so the two channels of the filter stay in phase and an older song sounds quiet and an octave higher. A song file does not say which driver it was made with, so when the driver is Patch16 and a song that uses the AUTOFILTER is opened, RMT asks whether to play it with the RMT 1.28 Unpatched driver. The answer is for that song only: a new song or the next song opened uses the driver of the Options dialog again. A script (`rmt /SCRIPT:`) answers No; it chooses the driver with `set driver`.

## RMT 1.28 Patch Prince of Persia by VinsCool

This driver version is an older patch based on the original RMT 1.28 Patch 8 by Analmux.
This version was created exclusively for the Prince of Persia soundtrack.
It was thus never really used outside of a very few test tunes that used some of the sounds.
